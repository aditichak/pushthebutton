# PushTheButton

The purpose of this application is to give people dealing with addictions an easy and thought-free method of notifying their support network when they need help. 

At the push of a button, text messages are sent to their sponsers informing that their sponsee is struggling and needs help, along with the current location of the sponsee. 

This application also helps people in recovery keep track of the number of days they have remained abstinent and how often they feel the urge to misuse substances and relapse.
